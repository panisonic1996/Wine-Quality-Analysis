### Wine-Quality-Analysis
#### This is a project to explore the various characteristics and quality of wine. Data for analysis has been taken from the site “https://winestatistics.com/”.

“WineStatistics is a wine tasting community, meant to describe modern wine by quantifying its subjective qualities (visual aspect, nose and palate) into comparable data indexes, so that the end result is a easy-to-read and 100% comparable wine rating system.  Our goal is to provide you, the reader, with a flexible tool, that will allow you to compare wines side by side. For example, you will be able to compare a wine that you have tasted, to a wine you only intend to taste or buy”.
Wines are evaluated according to the following indicators:
color, aroma, flavor, sweetness, alcohol, acidity, tannin, balance, finish, aftertaste.
Wine rating has following structure:
93 – 100 (great) - a wine that has all the traits to become legendary
91 – 92 (fine) - a wine of premium quality with good potential
89 – 90 (nice) - a well made wine that lacks elegance and finesse
75 – 88 (fair) - a decent wine that lacks character and structure

### Project steps:
1). The parser from the dynamic page went to a separate page for each wine, collected data, downloaded images, processed and extracted data from them and put everything to a csv document(for scraping were used Beautiful Soup и easyocr)
